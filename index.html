                <p id="bio">I’m a full stack developer who loves the creativity of front-end design and the technical side of back-end development.  When I’m not busy learning code and growing as a developer, I can be found face first in a book or deep in a new crotchet project.  Creating new things is my passion, so I’m always excited to delve into a project and bring something fresh and innovative to life.  My love of books led me to wanting to write my own stories and I am currently working on a young adult fantasy novel, which I hope to one day get published.</p>

                            <p id="modaltext">The challenge was to create a simple, single page, biographical website about a person close to me.  The subject I chose was my mother.  The website was created using HTML and CSS and shows the application of concepts I learned in beginning web development courses.  This was the first website I ever created, and I learned a lot in its creation.  The most important takeaways I came away with from this challenge are the importance of designing with responsiveness and accessibility in mind from the beginning.  These are lessons I have now learned to apply in all my future creations.<br />

I also learned how to accurately use modals and the importance of variable and function naming.
